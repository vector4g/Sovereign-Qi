You can structure the Omniverse + Isaac Sim demo as a short story: “we build a safe digital twin of power, simulate majority vs. Qi governance, and never touch a real person’s data.”[1][2]

## 1. Frame the narrative (2–3 min)

- Open with the Sovereign Qi promise: *Simulation Before Legislation* and “train on the struggle, not the identity,” then show one slide with Majority Logic vs. Qi Logic and the three metrics (innovation velocity, burnout, liability).[2][3]
- State what Omniverse + Isaac are doing in plain terms: **high‑fidelity social digital twin** where autonomous agents stand in for staff, citizens, and leadership so policy can be A/B‑tested safely.[4][1]

## 2. Build the digital twin scene

- Start from an Isaac Sim demo or custom USD scene that looks like an office, council chamber, or operations center; use SimReady assets so it feels physically real but clearly synthetic.[5][2]
- Populate the scene with “roles, not people”: agents tagged as manager, case worker, trans patient, neurodivergent student, etc., and show their state overlays (stress, risk, access) in the UI as the demo’s main visual feedback.[6][7]

## 3. Show Majority Logic vs. Qi Logic

- Run Scenario A: “Majority Logic” – policies optimized for averages; let agents follow scripts where edge‑case personas hit friction (blocked access, mis‑routed tickets, unsafe escalation), and display metrics degrading over simulated weeks.[8][1]
- Run Scenario B: “Qi Logic” – flip a toggle in the UI that loads different policy parameters (access rules, escalation thresholds, communication styles), then fast‑forward simulated months and show improvements in innovation velocity, burnout, and risk.[9][2]

## 4. Integrate Replicator + synthetic personas

- Cut to an Omniverse Replicator view: show a gallery of synthetic “data‑poor” edge cases being generated (e.g., Black trans woman in healthcare, autistic student in school, refugee navigating benefits), with domain randomization visible (lighting, context, language).[10][11]
- Make the point on‑screen: “no real humans in this dataset” and briefly show the parameter panel for distributions that define *challenges*, not identities, tying back to “train on the struggle.”[12][10]

## 5. Close with ZK leadership + call to action

- Overlay a simple event: an avatar walks to a secure door; the UI shows `HAS_VALID_ACCESS_TOKEN? → PROOF_VALIDATED (True) → IDENTITY_LOGGED: NULL`, linking the digital twin back to Qi Wallet and zero‑knowledge leadership.[3][13]
- End on a single Isaac Sim dashboard view with three KPIs and the line: “This all happened in simulation, not on your staff or communities. The next step is connecting your governance rules and risk thresholds into this twin.”[2][4]

If you share which audience this demo is for first (regulators, enterprise security, or city leadership), the next step can be a scene + run‑of‑show tailored to that room.
