Great progress on text legibility! Now let's optimize the card layout to showcase more of the professional photography while keeping text readable.

LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION:

1. IMAGE POSITIONING:
   - Change background-position from "center" to "center top"
   - This ensures faces and key photo elements stay visible at the top
   - Photos should occupy roughly the top 50-60% of card space

2. TEXT CONTENT POSITIONING:
   - Move ALL text content to bottom 40-50% of card
   - Use flexbox with justify-content: flex-end to push content down:
     .audience-card-content {
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
       justify-content: flex-end;
       height: 100%;
       padding: 2rem;
     }

3. GRADIENT OVERLAY ADJUSTMENT:
   - Keep gradient that's lighter at top (50% black), darker at bottom (85% black)
   - Current gradient is good: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.5), rgba(0,0,0,0.85))
   - This lets faces/photos show through at top, text is protected at bottom

4. TEXT PANEL REFINEMENT:
   - The semi-transparent dark panel should only wrap the text content
   - Position it at the bottom with padding
   - Leave the top 50% of card completely clear for photo visibility
   - Current backdrop-blur effect is perfect, keep it

5. ICON POSITIONING:
   - Move icon to be INSIDE the dark text panel (not floating above it)
   - Or reduce icon size slightly (from 56px to 48px) so it doesn't dominate

6. CARD HEIGHT:
   - Ensure cards are tall enough to show both photo and text: min-height: 500px
   - Or increase to 550px if current feels cramped

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
Top 50-60%: Professional photography clearly visible
Bottom 40-50%: Dark panel with all text content
- Icon (48px)
- Headline (bold, large)
- Role bullets (white with purple glow)
- Value proposition (cyan)

The goal: When someone glances at the cards, they should see:
1. FIRST: The professional person/people in the photo (human connection)
2. SECOND: The headline (Legal & Compliance, etc.)
3. THIRD: The details (roles and value prop)

This creates "magazine cover" style cards where the photo is the hero and text is cleanly organized at bottom.
