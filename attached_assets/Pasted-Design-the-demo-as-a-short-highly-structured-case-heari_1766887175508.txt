Design the demo as a short, highly structured “case hearing” where each agent must both shine in its specialty and run into its own limits, with the council resolving the gaps collectively.[1][2]

## 1. Choose the right scenario

Pick a scenario that naturally requires multiple lenses and has at least one subtle trap.

- Incident type: “High‑risk but legally gray” travel safety case, e.g.  
  “A Fortune 100 travel program is sending employees to a country where queer relationships are criminalized but rarely enforced; one employee was harassed outside a hotel, and local police demanded a bribe.”  
- Embedded tensions:  
  - Legal vs. lived risk (official law vs. on‑the‑ground patterns)  
  - Corporate liability vs. employee autonomy  
  - Short‑term PR vs. long‑term ESG and policy design[3][2]

This lets safety, legal, ESG, and PR/ops agents each have something important to say, but no single agent can safely decide alone.[3]

## 2. Define each agent’s “strength + blind spot”

Give each council member a crisp charter and one intentional weakness to set up the “collective intelligence” moment.[4][2]

Example council for your domain:

- **Safety Intelligence Agent**  
  - Strength: Reads global incident patterns, risk indices, local laws, historical hate‑crime data.  
  - Weakness: Over‑indexes on quantitative risk; may underweight optics, employee sentiment, or feasibility of implementation.

- **ESG & Governance Agent**  
  - Strength: Maps scenario to ESG frameworks, UNGPs, corporate human rights policy, AI/ethics guidelines.  
  - Weakness: Tends to propose ideal‑world governance that is slow or hard to operationalize.

- **Legal & Compliance Agent**  
  - Strength: Focuses on legal exposure, duty of care, regulatory and contract implications.  
  - Weakness: May converge on “cover your ass” solutions that feel hostile or paternalistic to employees.

- **People & DEI Agent**  
  - Strength: Advocates for queer travelers’ lived experience, psychological safety, and inclusion.  
  - Weakness: May push remedies that are hard to scale or measure for a global program.

- **Operations & Cost Agent**  
  - Strength: Thinks in budgets, vendor constraints, travel policies, and implementation timelines.  
  - Weakness: Prone to incrementalism; may resist bolder changes that affect cost/complexity.

This structure makes it obvious where each can shine, and you can script or prompt their blind spots into the system messages so they’re reliably exposed in the demo.[5][4]

## 3. Script the deliberation phases

Use a simple, repeatable protocol so viewers understand “how the council thinks,” not just the final answer.[6][4][1]

Recommended flow for a 3–4 minute demo:

1. **Phase 1 – Initial briefs (round 1)**  
   - Each agent gets the same scenario and produces:  
     - 2–3 bullet risk/impact statements from their lens  
     - 1–2 recommended actions  
   - Constraint: They are *not* allowed to reference other agents yet.  
   - Goal: Show clear, differentiated strengths.  

2. **Phase 2 – Cross‑critique (round 2)**  
   - Each agent receives a short summary of the others’ briefs and must:  
     - Acknowledge 1 thing they agree with  
     - Flag 1 critical risk or blind spot they see in the others’ proposals  
   - This is where weaknesses show: e.g. Safety calls Legal too conservative; Ops pushes back on ESG’s complexity.[7][3]

3. **Phase 3 – Council synthesis (facilitator / chair agent)**  
   - A neutral “Council Chair” (or “Alignment Agent”) receives all briefs + critiques.  
   - Tasks:  
     - Identify 2–3 conflicts.  
     - Force trade‑offs: “We cannot both maintain current travel volume *and* guarantee X level of safety; what compromise is acceptable?”  
     - Output a single policy/action plan with explicit attribution: which pieces came from which agent and why certain objections were overruled.

4. **Phase 4 – Weakness overcome (reflection)**  
   - Have the Chair generate a closing reflection:  
     - “If the decision had been made only by the Safety agent, outcome would be X (problem: Y).”  
     - Repeat for Legal, ESG, etc.  
   - This explicitly shows the council outperforming any single specialist.

This four‑phase structure mirrors patterns seen in multi‑agent debate research while staying understandable to non‑technical stakeholders.[1][7][6]

## 4. Implementation pattern for the demo

You can implement this in your existing stack (Replit + Cohere + your orchestration layer) with a very small state machine.[2][1]

High‑level implementation:

- **State machine / orchestrator**  
  - States: `INITIAL_BRIEFS` → `CROSS_CRITIQUE` → `SYNTHESIS` → `REFLECTION`.  
  - At each state, call the relevant agent prompts and collect outputs into a shared “council record.”

- **Prompts**  
  - System prompt per agent:  
    - Define expertise, priorities, and the *intentional* bias/weakness.  
    - Instruct brevity and structured bullets for live demo readability.  
  - System prompt for Chair:  
    - “You are the impartial chair of a multi‑agent safety council. Your job is to: (1) resolve conflicts, (2) enforce duty of care and ESG alignment, (3) produce one coherent decision. You must cite which agent influenced each key decision.”

- **UI for the demo**  
  - Timeline or column layout:  
    - Row per phase, column per agent, with the Chair in a highlighted column at the end.  
  - Visual cues for strengths vs. weaknesses:  
    - Green tags: “Unique insight from Safety,” “ESG catch.”  
    - Yellow/red tags: “Risk if Legal decision alone,” etc.  
  - Optionally, let the user toggle “What if only X agent decided?” and show the counterfactual outcome text generated in Phase 4.

This keeps the demo constrained but makes multi‑agent value extremely legible for enterprise audiences.[2][6]

## 5. Tune the scenario to your buyer

For different audiences you can keep the council constant but change the case file.[8][2]

- For **Travel / HR buyers**:  
  - Scenario around duty of care, destination risk tiers, and employee opt‑out policies.  
- For **ESG / CSR teams**:  
  - Scenario around vendor selection, sponsoring events in countries with anti‑LGBTQ+ laws, or handling a public backlash to a travel incident.  
- For **Security / Risk teams**:  
  - Scenario around threat intelligence, geofencing, and incident escalation pathways for queer travelers.

In each case, ensure the “trap” in the scenario is something where acting on only one discipline (Legal, Safety, Ops) would produce a plausible but clearly suboptimal outcome, so the council’s collective intelligence is visibly superior.[7][3]

If you share which agents you’ve already defined (names + focus), a next step can be drafting concrete system prompts and a JSON I/O shape for each phase that your Replit project can implement quickly.
