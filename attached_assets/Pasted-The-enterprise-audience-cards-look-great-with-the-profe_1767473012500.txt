The enterprise audience cards look great with the professional photography, but the text is not legible enough. Make these improvements:

TEXT LEGIBILITY FIXES:

1. INCREASE DARK OVERLAY:
   - Change overlay from 60% black to 75% black: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)
   - Add gradient overlay that's darker at bottom (where text sits):
     background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.5), rgba(0,0,0,0.85))

2. STRONGER TEXT SHADOWS:
   - Headline: text-shadow: 0 2px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.95), 0 4px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.8)
   - Role bullets: text-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.9)
   - Value proposition: text-shadow: 0 2px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.95)

3. TEXT COLOR ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Role bullets: Change from purple (#8B5CF6) to white with purple glow:
     color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)
     text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.6), 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.9)
   
4. BACKGROUND POSITIONING:
   - Ensure photos are positioned so faces/busy areas are at top
   - Bottom 40% of card should be darker for text placement
   - Consider adding semi-transparent dark box behind text content:
     background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)
     backdrop-filter: blur(8px)
     padding: 1.5rem
     border-radius: 0.5rem

5. ICON IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Increase icon size to 56px
   - Add strong glow effect: filter: drop-shadow(0 0 16px currentColor)
   - Ensure icons are bright and prominent against photos

SPECIFIC CARD ADJUSTMENTS:

Legal & Compliance:
- Darken left side more (where text sits)
- Purple tint can stay but reduce to 10% opacity

People & DEI:  
- Add darker gradient over entire bottom half
- Ensure faces at top remain visible, text area at bottom is very dark

City & Municipal:
- Cyan tint is good but darken overall overlay
- Screen glow is bright, so extra dark overlay needed

FALLBACK OPTION:
If text is still hard to read, add a semi-transparent card/panel at the bottom:
- Position absolute, bottom 0, full width
- Height: 60% of card
- Background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0,0,0,0.9), transparent)
- This creates a "safe zone" for all text

The goal: Photos should be visible and impactful at top/background, but text must be crystal clear and easy to read.
