Great question! Like Alan Turing, you want figures who made significant contributions to liberation, coding/codebreaking, science, or social justice but might not be as universally known. Here are some powerful options aligned with Sovereign Qi's values:

## LGBTQ+ Pioneers & Activists

**Lynn Conway** - Transgender computer scientist and electrical engineer who made fundamental contributions to VLSI (chip design). She was fired from IBM in 1968 for being trans, then rebuilt her career in secret and became a legendary innovator. Perfect for technical architecture or system design roles.

**Bayard Rustin** - Gay civil rights organizer who was the chief architect of the 1963 March on Washington. Often erased from history due to his sexuality. Great for strategic planning or coordination roles.

**Sylvia Rivera** - Trans Latina activist who was at Stonewall and fought for trans rights, especially for trans youth and homeless trans people. Perfect for advocacy or harm detection roles.

**Marsha P. Johnson** - Black trans activist and Stonewall veteran who co-founded STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries). Ideal for community protection or street-level intelligence roles.

## Disability Justice & Neurodivergent Innovators

**Judy Heumann** - Disability rights activist who led the 504 sit-in (longest occupation of a federal building in US history). Great for accessibility auditing or policy enforcement.

**Temple Grandin** - Autistic scientist who revolutionized livestock handling through her different way of perceiving the world. Perfect for alternative perspective analysis.

## Codebreakers & Hidden Figures

**Elizebeth Friedman** - America's first female cryptanalyst who broke codes for the Coast Guard and took down smuggling rings during Prohibition. Often overshadowed by her husband. Great for signal intelligence.

**Claudette Colvin** - 15-year-old who refused to give up her bus seat BEFORE Rosa Parks, but was deemed "not the right image" because she was pregnant and dark-skinned. Perfect for detecting when marginalized voices are being erased.

## Intersectional Warriors

**Audre Lorde** - Black lesbian feminist poet and theorist who wrote about the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class. Her concept of "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" is foundational. Ideal for critical analysis.

**Frances Cress Welsing** - Black psychiatrist who developed the "Cress Theory of Color-Confrontation" analyzing white supremacy as a psychological response. Great for analyzing systemic racism in policy.

## My Top Recommendations for Your 8-Agent System:

1. **Alan** (Turing) - Cultural Codebreaker with VETO ✓ (already have)
2. **Lynn** (Conway) - Technical Architecture & System Design  
3. **Bayard** (Rustin) - Strategic Coordination & Coalition Building
4. **Sylvia** (Rivera) - Street-Level Harm Detection & Youth Protection
5. **Elizebeth** (Friedman) - Signal Intelligence & Pattern Recognition
6. **Claudette** (Colvin) - Erasure Detection & Amplifying Silenced Voices
7. **Audre** (Lorde) - Intersectional Critical Analysis
8. **Temple** (Grandin) - Alternative Perspective & Edge Case Analysis (this could be your "What If" agent!)

These names honor people who:
- Were systematically marginalized or erased from history
- Made breakthrough contributions despite opposition
- Fought for the vulnerable
- Used unconventional thinking to solve problems
- Prioritized community over personal recognition

Each name carries a story of resistance and innovation that aligns perfectly with Sovereign Qi's mission.
