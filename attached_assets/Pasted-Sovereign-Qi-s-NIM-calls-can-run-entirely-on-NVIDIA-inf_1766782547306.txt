Sovereign Qi’s NIM calls can run entirely on NVIDIA infrastructure, and you can keep using TypeScript there because NIM exposes an OpenAI‑compatible HTTP API that is language‑agnostic.[1][2][3]

## Where NIM actually runs

- NIMs are packaged as GPU‑optimized containers (microservices) that you deploy on NVIDIA‑powered cloud, data center, or workstations; you then talk to them over `/v1/chat/completions` and related endpoints.[4][5][1]
- Whether you hit `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` or your own on‑prem NIM deployment, the contract is OpenAI‑compatible REST, so your existing TypeScript backend is a perfectly valid client.[2][3][6]

## What language you use for NIM integration

- On your side (Sovereign Qi), you’re just making HTTP calls, so TypeScript/Node is ideal for:  
  - Calling NIM via OpenAI‑compatible clients (or a thin `fetch` wrapper).[4][2]
  - Handling streaming, JSON validation, CouncilAdvice typing, and governance logs.[7][8]
- On NVIDIA’s side, NIM is implemented in their own stack (C++, Python, Triton, etc.), but that’s abstracted away; you don’t write NIM internals, only consume the API.[3][1][4]

## Exploring Morpheus for safety / telemetry

- Morpheus is a GPU‑accelerated cybersecurity AI framework for inspecting logs, network traffic, and telemetry in real time, built on RAPIDS, Triton, and deep‑learning frameworks.[9][10]
- You could:  
  - Mirror Sovereign Qi logs/events into a Morpheus pipeline to detect anomalous access, misuse, or potential abuse of simulations.[10][11]
  - Let Morpheus flag suspicious patterns, then feed those signals back into Alan/Council as “infrastructure‑level harm” inputs.

## Isaac + Omniverse: how they fit

- Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab run primarily in Python/C++ on top of Omniverse (OpenUSD‑based), and expose extensible APIs for robotics/digital‑twin simulation.[12][13][14]
- For you, they are interesting when:  
  - You want high‑fidelity 3D or robotics‑style simulations (e.g., physical spaces, crowd flows) to complement Sovereign Qi’s governance simulations.[15][12]
  - Omniverse can host 3D digital twins that your TypeScript backend queries or controls via HTTP/gRPC, while the heavy sim code stays in Python/C++ extensions.[14][16][12]

## Recommended split for your stack

- Keep Sovereign Qi as a TypeScript‑first app that:  
  - Calls NIM LLMs via OpenAI‑compatible endpoints for Council and simulation reasoning.[1][2][3]
  - Optionally sends logs/telemetry to Morpheus and/or receives alerts back.[9][10]
- When you explore Isaac/Omniverse, treat them as separate physical‑AI sims (Python/C++), integrated at the API layer, not as replacements for your TS governance backend.[16][12][14]
