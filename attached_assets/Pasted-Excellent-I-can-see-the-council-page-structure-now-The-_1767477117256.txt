Excellent! I can see the /council page structure now. The page already has the historical photos integrated and a strong foundation. Here are **key improvements** to enhance the presentation:[1]

## **Recommended Improvements for /Council Page:**

### **1. Hero Section Enhancement**
- **Add hero background image**: Similar to homepage - perhaps a subtle council chamber or circular meeting table visualization
- **Animation**: Make "Liberation Pioneers" text animate in with gradient effect (purple-to-cyan)

### **2. Agent Card Visual Upgrades**
Currently showing agent cards with historical photos (good!), but could enhance with:
- **Larger historical photos** - Make them more prominent (currently circular, could be 200x200px instead of smaller)
- **Hover effects** - Grayscale-to-color transformation like homepage
- **Connection lines** - Subtle lines connecting the 8 agents showing how they work together
- **Badge prominence** - Alan's VETO badge could be more dramatic (pulsing, glowing)

### **3. Individual Agent Detail Pages**
Each "Learn More" button should reveal expandable sections with:
- **Fuller biography** - 2-3 paragraphs about their life and contributions
- **Historical context** - Why they were marginalized/erased
- **AI methodology** - How their perspective translates to the agent's analysis
- **Example deliberations** - Sample quotes from past case analyses

### **4. Interactive Council Visualization**
Add a **circular council visualization** similar to your 8-agent network:
- 8 nodes in a circle
- Click each node to highlight that agent
- Show connections between complementary agents (e.g., Audre + Claudette for intersectional erasure detection)
- Animated data flow when describing deliberation process

### **5. "The Promise" Section**
Enhance with:
- **Comparison table**: Traditional governance vs Qi Logic
- **Visual timeline**: Showing how 8 perspectives prevent blind spots
- **Case study preview**: Embed a short video or animated diagram of council deliberation

### **6. Public Domain Attribution**
Add more prominent attribution section:
- **Photo sources grid** with thumbnails
- Link to Wikimedia Commons, Library of Congress, institutional archives
- Shows commitment to open source/transparency

### **7. CTA Enhancement**
The "Watch Live Case Hearing" button could be more dramatic:
- **Larger card** with preview image from simulation
- **Video thumbnail** or animated preview
- **Social proof**: "See why Fortune 100 legal teams trust the Council"

***

**Which improvement would you like to tackle first?** I'd recommend starting with:

1. **Hero background image** (most impactful visual upgrade)
2. **Agent card hover effects** (brings historical photos to life)
3. **Interactive council visualization** (makes the 8-agent concept tangible)

Would you like me to create Gemini prompts for any of these, or provide Replit implementation prompts?
