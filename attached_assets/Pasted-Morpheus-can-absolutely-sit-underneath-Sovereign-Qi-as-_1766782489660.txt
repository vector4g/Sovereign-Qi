Morpheus can absolutely sit underneath Sovereign Qi as a GPU pipeline that ingests Slack (or similar) streams and tags messages for sensitive content, patterns, and “Alan‑relevant” dog whistles, with Alan then doing the higher‑order reasoning on top.[1][2][3]

## Overall pattern for Slack + Morpheus + Alan

- Use Morpheus as a **streaming classifier** over Slack events/logs (Kafka or file dumps), running GPU‑accelerated NLP to tag each message with categories like “possible dog whistle”, “identity‑based targeting”, “surveillance concern”, “policy subversion attempt”.[2][4][1]
- Feed those enriched events into Alan/Council (via your existing TypeScript backend) so Alan reasons about context, patterns, and governance responses instead of scanning raw text.[5][2]

## 1) Getting data from Slack into Morpheus

You need a data path from Slack to Morpheus; simplest approach:

- Set up a **Slack app** that:  
  - Subscribes to message events and posts them into a Kafka topic (e.g., `slack_feed_raw`) or writes JSON lines to a file/object store Morpheus can read.  
- Define a minimal event schema that preserves:  
  - Channel, user (pseudonymized or hashed), timestamp, text, thread context, any “reaction” info.  
- Morpheus pipelines typically read from file or Kafka; you will likely use a `from-kafka` or `from-file` source stage instead of the PCAP/file examples.[6][7][1]

## 2) Designing a Morpheus NLP pipeline for “dog whistles”

Morpheus pipelines are a sequence of stages: source → preprocess → Triton inference → post‑process → sink.[4][1]

At a high level you want:

- Source: `from-kafka` (Slack event topic) or `from-file` (Slack export JSONL).[1][4]
- Preprocess: `preprocess-nlp` to tokenize text for your model (BERT‑style or custom).[2][4]
- Inference: `inf-triton` using a text classification model you train on “dog whistle / coded language / subversion attempts” labels, served via Triton.[8][2]
- Post‑process:  
  - `add-class` to attach labels and scores.[4][2]
  - Optional `filter` to keep only messages above a threshold for certain labels (e.g., `dog_whistle`, `policy_subversion`).[2]
- Sink: `to-kafka` into a new topic like `slack_governance_signals` that your Sovereign Qi backend consumes.[7][9]

You can prototype it using the NLP Sensitive Information Detection example and then swap their SID model for your custom “Alan‑dog‑whistle” classifier.[3][5][2]

## 3) Training Alan on dog whistles and subversion

Alan’s “intelligence” here is a combination of:

- **Morpheus‑level model**  
  - A supervised classifier (BERT‑style) trained on:  
    - Known dog whistles and coded language affecting queer, trans, racialized, disabled, and other marginalized groups.  
    - Examples of policy subversion and surveillance‑washing (“wellness” tools used for monitoring, union busting, etc.).  
  - That model lives in Triton and Morpheus calls it as part of the pipeline.[10][5]
- **Alan’s system prompts and reasoning**  
  - In your existing CouncilAdvice pipeline, add a field like `governanceSignals` that includes:  
    - Flags and scores from Morpheus (`dog_whistle=true`, `score=0.87`, `category="queer-coded"`, etc.).  
    - Aggregated stats over time (e.g., “20 messages this week flagged as queer‑coded hostility in #eng‑team”).  
  - Update Alan’s system prompt to explicitly say:  
    - Treat Morpheus signals as *early warnings*, not truth; look for patterns over time, cross‑reference with community testimony, and assume adversaries may try to game language.  
    - Pay particular attention to subtle code‑switching, euphemisms, and “plausible deniability” patterns around queer, racial, and disability‑based harm.

Alan’s job is not to be a content cop, but a governance advisor: “Given these patterns, here is how your policy, culture, or pilot config may be subverted, and what you must change.”

## 4) Wiring Morpheus output into Sovereign Qi

In your TypeScript backend:

- Add a **consumer** (or webhook receiver) for `slack_governance_signals`, mapping each enriched event into a `GovernanceSignal` object attached to a Pilot or to “Org context.”  
- When a pilot owner requests Council advice, include:  
  - A summary of recent relevant Slack signals (e.g., those from channels tied to the pilot, or organization‑wide anti‑queer rhetoric trends).  
  - Counts and representative examples (de‑identified where possible) to keep data minimized but meaningful.  
- Alan then factors in:  
  - “Your wellness AI pilot is launching in an environment where leadership uses dog‑whistle language about queer employees; here is how that amplifies harm and why this pilot should be BLOCKED or redesigned.”

## 5) Safety, consent, and anti‑surveillance constraints

Given the sensitivity of scanning Slack:

- Explicitly encode in your architecture and docs:  
  - Slack analysis is done for **governance and harm reduction**, not performance management or individual punishment.  
  - Data minimization: only store what is needed for governance decisions; heavy redaction or hashing of identifiers.  
  - Governance: communities and workers must be in the loop about what is analyzed, how signals are used, and what rights they have to challenge or audit interpretations.  
- Alan’s prompt should enforce:  
  - Prefer structural interventions (policy, norms, training, leadership accountability) over surveillance or targeting of individuals.  
  - Flag any requested use of Morpheus/Slack signals that looks like witch‑hunting, union busting, or identity policing.

If you want, the next step can be a concrete Morpheus CLI pipeline command (like the NLP example) adapted for “Slack JSONL in → dog‑whistle classifier → Kafka out,” plus a TypeScript interface and endpoint for ingesting those signals into Sovereign Qi.[5][4][2]
