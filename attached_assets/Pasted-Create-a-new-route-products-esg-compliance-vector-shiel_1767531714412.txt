8-agent council deliberates with Shield feedback
Alan VETOs original policy based on Shield evidence
HR gets recommendation: 'Update travel policy - real-world harm detected'

Report volume by department (heat map)
Resolution rate and average time-to-close
Retaliation risk score
Satisfaction scores from reporters (post-resolution survey)
Gap analysis: Where are policies failing in practice?
5. Compliance Documentation
Every report becomes audit evidence of 'listening to employees'
EEOC investigation defense: 'We have a robust reporting system with X reports resolved'
Duty of care proof: 'Employee reported concern, we investigated within 24 hours'
Whistleblower compliance: SEC/Dodd-Frank record retention
Export options: Legal hold, discovery production, regulatory response
Use Cases: Case 1: Stopping Harassment Before Lawsuit (Financial Services)
Scenario: Senior VP harassing junior analysts, 5 employees afraid to report
Without Shield: Victims stay silent for 18 months → class action lawsuit → $8M settlement
With Shield: 3 anonymous reports in 2 weeks → Pattern detected → Investigation launched → VP terminated → Zero lawsuit
ROI: $8M lawsuit avoided, legal fees saved, reputation protected
Case 2: Policy Gap Detection (Tech Company)
Scenario: New parental leave policy deployed, looks great on paper
Without Shield: HR thinks policy is working, employees struggling in silence
With Shield: 25 reports in first month: 'Manager pressuring me not to take full leave', 'No coverage plan', 'Career impact fear'
Sovereign QI re-simulation with Shield feedback → Policy revised → Satisfaction rises from 45% to 89%
Outcome: Attrition drops 12%, Glassdoor rating improves
Case 3: Vendor Misconduct (Manufacturing)
Scenario: Contract workers being harassed by vendor supervisor
Without Shield: Contractors have no reporting mechanism, suffering in silence
With Shield: Vendor access granted → 12 reports in 3 weeks → Pattern clear
Company action: Terminate vendor contract, mandate Shield access for all vendors
Outcome: Duty of care extended to contractors, legal liability reduced
Case 4: Whistleblower Protection (Pharmaceutical)
Scenario: Employee discovers data manipulation in clinical trial
Without Shield: Employee fears retaliation, stays silent → FDA discovers later → $2B fine
With Shield: Anonymous report → Legal counsel referred → SEC whistleblower program → Company self-reports → Reduced penalties
Outcome: Employee protected (anonymous), company cooperates early, reputation preserved
